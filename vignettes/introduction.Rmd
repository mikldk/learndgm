## Introduction

First, the library is loaded:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(structlearn)
```


```{r}
data(danedb)
db <- danedb
db[, "DYS389II"] <- db[, "DYS389II"] - db[, "DYS389I"]
```

```{r}
d <- prepare_data(db)
print(d)
plot(d)
```

```{r}
clfit <- chow_liu(d)
clfit
plot(clfit, layout = layout_as_tree)
```

```{r}
cl_to_tcherry(clfit)
```



```{r}
# library(bnlearn)
# db_fact <- data.frame(apply(db, 2, as.character), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
# out <- capture.output(chow_liu_fit_undirected <- chow.liu(db_fact, mi = "mi", debug = TRUE))
# out
# 
# plot(chow_liu_fit_undirected, layout = layout_as_tree)
# 
# chow_liu_fit <- cextend(chow_liu_fit_undirected) # To get a DAG, extension is needed
# plot(chow_liu_fit, layout = layout_as_tree)

Chapter 3
On the Approximation of a Discrete
Multivariate Probability Distribution Using
the New Concept of t-Cherry Junction Tree

3.3.3  The Relation Between the Approximations Associated to the First-Order Dependence Tree and t-Cherry-Junction Tree

Cherry trees:

(Vertices, Edges, Cherries)

Cherry: (i, j, k), j middle, edge i-j-k
Only cherry with two vertices is o--o

From a cherry tree we can obtain another cherry tree by adding a new vertex, j, and
connecting the new vertex with two already existing vertices i and k by two new edges (i-j and j-k).
These two edges constitute a cherry (i, j, k). So

   j
   o
  / \
 o   o
 i   k
is a cherry tree with cherry (i, j, k).

Note that
   j
   o
  /
 o 
 i
is the only cherry tree with two vertices.

A new cherry tree can be obtained as described above.

Cherry tree not uniquely determined by its graph. 
The same graph can represent more cherry trees.

Note that in a cherry tree there is exactly one edge which is not part of a
cherry.


t-cherry tree:
Above we had

> From a cherry tree we can obtain another cherry tree by adding a new vertex, j, and
connecting the new vertex with two already existing vertices i and k by two new edges (i-j and j-k).
These two edges constitute a cherry (i, j, k).

If we instead use

> By connecting a new vertex of V by two new edges to two connected vertices
of a cherry tree, one obtains a new cherry tree.

we get a t-cherry tree instead of a cherry tree.


Remark 3.2. From a set of n vertices we obtain a cherry tree with n - 2 cherries.

Remark 3.5. A pair of adjacent vertices from the t-cherry tree may be used several
times, for connecting new vertices to them.

Algorithm 2.

```{r}
#1) the spanning tree behind the Chowâ€“Liu
#2) construct a t-cherry tree from this spanning tree
#3) Algorithm 1: assign a t-cherry-junction tree to this t-cherry tree

# Algorithm 2.:
# 1. The first cherry of the t-cherry tree let be defined by any three vertices of the
# spanning tree which are connected by two edges.
# 2. We add a new cherry to the t-cherry tree by taking a new vertex of the spanning
# tree adjacent to the so far constructed t-cherry tree.
# 3. We repeat step (2) till all vertices from the spanning tree become included in the
# t-cherry tree.
